### Hi, I am **Varun**!
AI developer working in the enhancement and development of applications based on Large Language Models (LLMs).

**Developing Open-Source software - [AVNLP](https://avnlp.github.io/):**
  - **[BioThink](https://github.com/avnlp/biothink)**:  Self-Reflective Question-Answering for Biomedical Reasoning.
  - **[LLM-Finetuning](https://github.com/avnlp/llm-finetuning)**: Pipelines for Fine-Tuning LLMs using SFT and RLHF.
  - **[GRPO](https://github.com/avnlp/grpo)**: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) Implementations.
  - **[RAG-Model-Training](https://github.com/avnlp/rag-model-training)**: Training LLMs for Retrieval Augmented Generation.
  - **[RAG Pipelines](https://github.com/avnlp/rag-pipelines)**: Advanced RAG Pipelines and Evaluation: Self-Reflective RAG, Corrective RAG, Adaptive RAG, Sub-Query Generation and Routing, DeepEval.
  - **[DSPy-Opt](https://github.com/avnlp/dspy-opt)**: Advanced RAG Pipelines optimized with DSPy.
  - **[PRP](https://github.com/avnlp/prp)**: Implementation of Pairwise Ranking Prompting (PRP) technique.
  - **[Rankers](https://github.com/avnlp/rankers)**: LLM based Pairwise, Setwise, and Listwise rankers.
  - **[RRF](https://github.com/avnlp/rrf)**: Performance Evaluation of Rankers and RRF Techniques for Retrieval Pipelines.
  - **[LLM Blender](https://github.com/avnlp/llm-blender)**: Ensembling LLMs using LLM-Blender.
  
- **[Financial Dashboard :](https://github.com/vrunm/Financial_Dashboard)**
Built an end-to-end Financial Dashboard that collects and consolidates all of a business's critical observations in one place using the information obtained from the annual 10-K SEC Filings.
The financial dashboard contains:

    - Insights and summaries for different sections from annual corporate filings.
   
    - Sentiment-based score that measures the company's performance over a certain time period.
   
    - Identification of Important topics and Frequently occuring words mentioned in the report.  

**Open Source Contributions**:
  - **[Haystack](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack)**: [deepset-ai/haystack](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+vrunm), [deepset-ai/haystack-core-integrations](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack-core-integrations/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Avrunm+is%3Aclosed+sort%3Aupdated-desc)
